# Trying to leave the EU: why the UK parliament fails to reach deadlines.
Repository for TMCI project November 2019. Project members: Jan Koetsier, Caoimhe Martin, Lily Voge and Tjalie Wichers Schreur

## Abstract
After the referendum in June 2016 it became apparent that the UK will leave the EU. However, this proved to be difficult resulting in long negotiations and failed deals (Brexit: All the…, 2019). There have been many deadlines that haven’t been met and the process keeps being extended, leaving the British and also the European population in much uncertainty. We would like to analyse for what reasons the UK parliament keeps denying deals and extending the deadline. Firstly, we would like to look at the frequency of brexit debates over a span of time to see whether brexit is being dealt with as extensively right before the deadline as throughout the rest of the year. Additionally, we would like to look at the context in which brexit is mentioned and whether these contexts also change as the pressure increases.

## Research questions
Does the political conversation around brexit change as the deadline nears?

## Dataset
Brexit is extensively discussed in the UK parliament of which transcripts are available online. Through web scraping we hope to create a text file containing all parliament discussions since June 2016 where Brexit is mentioned. This will be our data set.

## A tentative list of milestones for the project
### Milestones
- Week 1
	- Gather sources about webscraping and useful corpora for analysis
	- Start with webscraping
	- Understand Parliament structure
	- Understand website structure (there are text files) -> gathering data set through web scraping -> also need the date for each text file
	- Make a list of words we are going to search for
- Week 2
	- Plotting frequency of brexit mentions throughout time
	- Plotting vector with co-occurrences throughout time
- Week 3
	- Analysing findings, answering the research question

## Division of work:
#### Tjalie
- Set up git environment
- Make readme
- Editing
- Maintain GitHub repository
- Possibly something extra
#### Jan
- Web Scraping
#### Caoimhe
- Plotting vector with co-occurrences per month
#### Lily
- Plotting vector with co-occurrences throughout time
- Write report 

## Documentation
This can be added as the project unfolds. You should describe, in particular, what your repo contains and how to reproduce your results.
