Mr Speaker       Share       I must now call on the Members of the House, according to the usual custom, to take the Oath of Allegiance or to affirm at the Table of the House, first doing so myself. The Speaker first, alone, standing on the upper step of the Chair, made and subscribed the Affirmation required by law.     Share          The edit just sent has not been saved.  The following error was returned:     This content has already been edited and is awaiting review.     Mr Speaker       Share       I should remind hon. Members that until they take the Oath or affirm, they must not sit during any debate or vote in any Division of the House, and will not receive any salary. The arrangements for swearing in are set out in the Chamber information sheet, and a guidance note is also available from the Table and Vote Offices. I propose to call first the Father of the House, then members of the Cabinet, then members of the shadow Cabinet, then all Privy Counsellors not included in those two groups, wherever they may be sitting, and then other Ministers. Thereafter, I shall call other hon. Members according to the Parliament of their first entry, or, for those with broken service, that of most recent entry. The first batch will be those who have been Members since before the 2010 general election. Thereafter I shall proceed to call Members by successive Parliaments. I do not expect to call new Members until tomorrow. I propose to remain in the Chair until 5 pm today, and then to return at 5.30 pm and continue until 7.30 pm or later, as necessary. The House will sit again tomorrow at 9.30 am. I propose to be in the Chair for swearing in tomorrow from 9.30 am until 11.30 am, to return at 12 noon until 1.30 pm, and then again, if required, from 2.30 pm until 4.30 pm. I hope that by the end of tomorrow afternoon we will have made sufficient progress to enable all Members to swear in who wish to do so. However, if required, we will sit for swearing in at 2 pm on the day of the Queen’s Speech. [Interruption.] I am not in a position to divulge any further information on that matter. I hope that Members will come forward in an orderly manner. I remind Members that the swearing in, as a proceeding of the House, is recorded by the television cameras, and that anything said or done by Members may appear on television or be picked up by microphones. It will assist the broadcasters if new Members state their name and constituency when they come to the Dispatch Box. Progress will depend, of course, on the number of Members wishing to swear in at any particular time. I advise Members to watch the Annunciators to establish progress, and to speak to their Whips. In a moment, we will begin this process, as I indicated a few moments ago, with the Father of the House, but before we do so I want to make a very short statement. All of us will be aware of, and horrified by, the tragic fire that engulfed the vast majority of an enormous block of flats in London in the early hours of this morning. Colleagues, it is not possible to treat of that matter in the way that we otherwise, I am sure, would wish to do in the Chamber today. The Government are very sensitive to the concern that exists on this subject and my very clear understanding is that arrangements are in hand for a meeting with the relevant Minister to take place within the precincts of the Palace of Westminster. That meeting can be attended by colleagues gravely concerned about this matter, and no doubt questions can be put to the Minister and answers, such as he or she is able to give, can be provided. It will not be a proceeding of Parliament, and that would not be possible under our Standing Orders. Nor is it possible, after I have spoken, for anybody else to say anything. I just want, I am sure on behalf of each and every one of you in this Chamber, to offer our condolences to the families and friends of the victims of this unimaginable and horrific disaster. I want also, I am sure with your concurrence, to offer the warmest and most effusive thanks to our magnificent emergency services for coping as best they can in this horrendous situation. I hope colleagues will understand that we have to leave it there for now. Thank you. Let us now begin, and we do so, appropriately, with the Father of the House, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe.

Mr Speaker       Share       I have to report that this House has been in the House of Lords where Her Majesty, by Her Royal Commissioners, has been pleased to approve the choice made of myself for the Office of Speaker. I have, in your name and on your behalf, made claim by humble petition to Her Majesty to all your ancient and undoubted rights and privileges, particularly to freedom of speech in debate, freedom from arrest, and freedom of access to Her Majesty whenever occasion shall require, and that the most favourable construction shall be put upon all proceedings.  All these Her Majesty, by Her Commissioners, has been pleased to confirm in as ample a manner as they have ever been granted or confirmed by Herself or by any of Her Royal Predecessors. My first duty to the House is to report my respectful acknowledgement and grateful thanks for the great honour you have conferred upon me in placing me in the Chair.

Mr Speaker       Share       I must now call on the Members of the House, according to the usual custom, to take the Oath of Allegiance or to affirm at the Table of the House, first doing so myself. The Speaker first, alone, standing on the upper step of the Chair, made and subscribed the Affirmation required by law.     Share          The edit just sent has not been saved.  The following error was returned:     This content has already been edited and is awaiting review.     Mr Speaker       Share       I should remind hon. Members that until they take the Oath or affirm, they must not sit during any debate or vote in any Division of the House, and will not receive any salary. The arrangements for swearing in are set out in the Chamber information sheet, and a guidance note is also available from the Table and Vote Offices. I propose to call first the Father of the House, then members of the Cabinet, then members of the shadow Cabinet, then all Privy Counsellors not included in those two groups, wherever they may be sitting, and then other Ministers. Thereafter, I shall call other hon. Members according to the Parliament of their first entry, or, for those with broken service, that of most recent entry. The first batch will be those who have been Members since before the 2010 general election. Thereafter I shall proceed to call Members by successive Parliaments. I do not expect to call new Members until tomorrow. I propose to remain in the Chair until 5 pm today, and then to return at 5.30 pm and continue until 7.30 pm or later, as necessary. The House will sit again tomorrow at 9.30 am. I propose to be in the Chair for swearing in tomorrow from 9.30 am until 11.30 am, to return at 12 noon until 1.30 pm, and then again, if required, from 2.30 pm until 4.30 pm. I hope that by the end of tomorrow afternoon we will have made sufficient progress to enable all Members to swear in who wish to do so. However, if required, we will sit for swearing in at 2 pm on the day of the Queen’s Speech. [Interruption.] I am not in a position to divulge any further information on that matter. I hope that Members will come forward in an orderly manner. I remind Members that the swearing in, as a proceeding of the House, is recorded by the television cameras, and that anything said or done by Members may appear on television or be picked up by microphones. It will assist the broadcasters if new Members state their name and constituency when they come to the Dispatch Box. Progress will depend, of course, on the number of Members wishing to swear in at any particular time. I advise Members to watch the Annunciators to establish progress, and to speak to their Whips. In a moment, we will begin this process, as I indicated a few moments ago, with the Father of the House, but before we do so I want to make a very short statement. All of us will be aware of, and horrified by, the tragic fire that engulfed the vast majority of an enormous block of flats in London in the early hours of this morning. Colleagues, it is not possible to treat of that matter in the way that we otherwise, I am sure, would wish to do in the Chamber today. The Government are very sensitive to the concern that exists on this subject and my very clear understanding is that arrangements are in hand for a meeting with the relevant Minister to take place within the precincts of the Palace of Westminster. That meeting can be attended by colleagues gravely concerned about this matter, and no doubt questions can be put to the Minister and answers, such as he or she is able to give, can be provided. It will not be a proceeding of Parliament, and that would not be possible under our Standing Orders. Nor is it possible, after I have spoken, for anybody else to say anything. I just want, I am sure on behalf of each and every one of you in this Chamber, to offer our condolences to the families and friends of the victims of this unimaginable and horrific disaster. I want also, I am sure with your concurrence, to offer the warmest and most effusive thanks to our magnificent emergency services for coping as best they can in this horrendous situation. I hope colleagues will understand that we have to leave it there for now. Thank you. Let us now begin, and we do so, appropriately, with the Father of the House, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe.
